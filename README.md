## Angular 6 - Dota 2 Application
This application uses the dota 2 API: https://docs.opendota.com

Also, this application uses the Dota 2 cdn for images: http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/antimage_lg.png

I plan to make this into a Reactjs app once I learn a bit more about the framework.

The end goal is to make this into a MERN stack application!
