## Angular 6 - MOBA Application

This application, for now, will be used as a tool for learning more about state management with ngrx store and effects.

I plan to make this into a Reactjs app once I learn a bit more about the framework.

The end goal is to make this into a MERN stack application! The League of Legends API only works with Server side, it will not work with a javascript call since they want to protect their API keys.

Technologies I am working on learning through this application:
https://github.com/ngrx/store
https://github.com/ngrx/effects
